# context
Original code: https://github.com/fyrebolt/test (this repo is just a polished up version of the code, all test files have been archived to prevent potential server crashing)
Names of links were shortened and made more appropriate (home screen changed from loginInterface -> index, canvas changed from game10 -> canvas)
The only change added to the code was the immediate redirect to the canvas after making an account for QOL.

# how to use
Start here: fyrebolt.github.io/mosaic/index.html
Make and account and join the canvas. Use keyboard keys (0-9) to pick a color. 

# what the code is about
**-MOSAIC** was built for a hackathon under the theme of bridging. The goal of the project is to allow all users to collaborate on a piece of art, hence the name mosaic.
The canvas uses Wick Editor to get the frame-by-frame inputs from every user, and a Repl.it server is used to connect all users to the same canvas.
The activity recognition uses firebase accounts, and all user information is pushed to a database.

# resources used:
Languages: javascript, html, css  
Platforms: wick editor, firebase, websocket, repl.it, github

This is my first major project published under time pressure with completely original code and a original idea with a group of acquaintances.
Thank you @baron, @fufu, and @nyang for collaborating with me.
